AngularJS 1.5 Project Info:
Hi my name is Jonathan Hofler below are my 5 Angular projects

(app-gaming and app-gaming-alteration)

These 2 projects are (app-gaming and app-gaming-alteration) both are responsive and are my 1st advanced angular apps. Both of them are simular. Both apps were my attempt to replicate the GameFly.com web site with a background image and image changes on hover on the game page which I was able to achieve.

The app-gaming-alteration is the same as the previous app but uses more advanced angular directives, controllers, templates, and includes the google api map which has its own directive and controller. Both of these apps use Bootstrap 3.35.

With this project after you download it you will have to run a HTTP server from the folder due to the restrictions for Cross Origin Requests restriction in chrome and some other browsers. The directions of how to do this are found here.

(Bigblue & Bigblue-Rev)

Bigblue & Bigblue-Rev are my attempts to create a simple educational site that talks about the Blue Whale. Both sites have the full screen background slide show utilizing angular directives, controllers, templates, google maps api, and $http.get request which populates the google map markers from a json document or api call such as http://hotline.whalemuseum.orgGET /api.json?species=orca&near=48.5159,-123.1524&radius=0.5&limit=1000. Also on the overview page there are fields where you can guess the answer to questions. Both of these apps use Bootstrap 3.35.

The only difference between these the Bigblue and Bigblue-Rev is that Bligblue-Rev uses routes or $routeProvider to navigate from one page to another making the site a SPA or single page application.
