AngularJS 1.5 Project Info:

Hi my name is Jonathan. These 2 projects are (app-gaming and app-gaming-alteration) these are my 1st advanced angular apps. Both of them are simular. Both apps were my attempt to replicate the GameFly.com web site with a background image and image changes on hover on the game page. Which I was able to achieve with .

However the but different the app-gaming-alteration folder is the same as the previous app but uses more advanced angular directives, controllers, templates, and includes the google api map which has its own directive and controller. With this project after you download it you will have to run a HTTP server from the folder due to the restrictions for Cross Origin Requests restriction in chrome and some other browsers. The directions of how to do this are found here.
